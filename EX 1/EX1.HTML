    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juices.</li>
        <li>Add the meat pieces to the pot and cook until browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the yogurt and spices (turmeric, coriander, cumin, garam masala, chili powder, and salt). Cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
